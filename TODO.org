  - **Tax rate per item**
  - There are a lot of unsupported use cases here
  - For now, items are either taxed or untaxed, but the real world is
    far more complex :
    - Clients in other parts of the world are not subject to all taxes
    - There is a legal distinction between "no tax" and 0% tax

    - https://ici.radio-canada.ca/tele/la-facture/site/segments/reportage/199628/amazon-livre-taxes-tps-tvq-tvh-numerique
      - Au Québec, la vente de livres comportant un ISBN est
        généralement « détaxée ». Ce terme signifie que la vente est
        taxable, mais que le taux de la TVQ est ramené dans ce cas-ci
